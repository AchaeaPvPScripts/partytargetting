## Contributors
Fork the repo, then clone your fork locally. When you're done, push your updates through git (github desktop is great for this!) and then make a pull request. We'll look them over and, if they're good, pull them in; then you can delete your fork and start all over again! Try to keep PRs reasonably small, doing one thing at a time.
